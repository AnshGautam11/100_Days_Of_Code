100 Projects Challenge ðŸš€

Welcome to my 100 Projects Challenge repository!
This repo is my personal journey of creating 100 projects from basic to advanced level, where I aim to sharpen my coding, problem-solving, and cybersecurity skills step by step.

The main purpose behind this challenge is to build consistency, gain hands-on experience, and create a portfolio that reflects my progress as a developer and security enthusiast. Instead of just learning theory, I believe in learning by building. Each project will teach me something new, whether itâ€™s about programming concepts, automation, web development, or cybersecurity.

ðŸ”¥ What You Will Find Here

Beginner Projects â€“ Small coding exercises, basic logic building, and simple applications.

Intermediate Projects â€“ Scripts, automation tools, data handling, and problem-solving apps.

Advanced Projects â€“ Real-world applications, cybersecurity tools, penetration testing utilities, and web-based systems.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals of This Challenge

Improve Coding Skills â€“ By practicing regularly with practical projects.

Learn Consistently â€“ To stay motivated and push myself every day.

Build a Strong Portfolio â€“ Showcasing my skills to the developer and cybersecurity community.

Mix of Domains â€“ Programming, scripting, web development, and cybersecurity to cover multiple areas.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Throughout this journey, I will be using different technologies such as:

Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, Bash

Cybersecurity Tools: Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark

Frameworks: Flask, Streamlit, Node.js (later for advanced projects)

ðŸ“Œ Purpose of This Repo

This repository is not just a collection of random code but a structured roadmap of growth. By the end of these 100 projects, I aim to:

Strengthen my problem-solving mindset.

Understand real-world applications of coding and security.

Inspire others to take up a similar challenge.

Stay tuned as I upload projects regularly. This is just the beginning of my journey â€” 100 projects, countless lessons, and infinite growth ahead ðŸš€
